## User Experience
When you are hangry and desperate for some inspiration, a time consuming website should not be your next problem. This site is designed to be quick to use.

### User Stories
First time visitors should instantly get an overview of the site and get to know that this is a site that offers both inspiration and easy recipes.

Recurring visitors that know what they are looking for should be able to quickly get to the preferred page.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
![Image of the colour palette used](assets/images/readme-images/color-palette.png)

Red and yellow are known for triggering apetite. Remaining colours are preferred contrasting colours according to coolors.co from which the pallette is taken.

The plum color is used for text and borders. Remaining colours are background colours: red for header and footer, yellow for landing page, teal for inspiration page and lavender for recipe page.
### Typography
The site uses two fonts: "Poppins" for general text and "Madimi One" for headings. 

"Madimi One" is a fun, almost brush like font. It is a quite bold font, used in uppercase to make it stand out.

"Poppins" is a sans serif-font, a bit more easy to read.
### Imagery
Images are taken from pexels.com and Google pictures. All images are licensed to use in commercial products. 

Images to recipes and inspiration dishes are taken from above inside a round container (made round to resemble a plate). Food pictures taken from straight above is a common practice by food influencers and gives the visitor a consequent design.
### Wireframes 
These where the original ideas for the three different sections:

![Image of the wireframe for the landing page](assets/images/readme-images/LANDING-PAGE.png)
![Image of the wireframe for the inpiration page](assets/images/readme-images/INSPO.png)
![Image of the wireframe for the recipe page and footer](assets/images/readme-images/RECIPES.png)

It is easy to see where the initial design idea differs from the result. The content in the Inspo page used the space to inefficiently and a simpler design were used instead.

The contact feature in the footer was deleted due to not contributing to the user in this particular site.
## Features
This site contain three different sections in a single html-page:
- Landing page
- Inspo page
- Recipe page
### General Features on each page
**The Landing page** gives the visitor a short summary of what the page does and a navigation bar to easily get to the most important content.

**The Inspo page** gives the visitor inspiring pictures with the names of the dishes, categorized under cuisine.

**The Recipe page** gives the visitor quick and easy recipes with 3-5 ingredients that takes only a few miuntes to assemble. The recipe also have a feature where the visitor can sign up for the newsletter, for even more inspiration and recipes. The newsletter sign up-feature is located at the top of the recipe page. When using desktop it sticks to the top of the page when scrolling down. When using smaller screens it is revealed when clicking the newsletter-label.

The header sticks at the top of the viewport and gives the visitor access to the navigation bar anywhere on the site.

At the bottom the visitor find the footer which contain links to the social media accounts.

The site is responsive - the design changes to be more compatible depending on which screen size the visitor uses.
### Future Implementations
The site has an infinite number of possibilites to incorporate. Some features that are planned but not yet executed are:
- The possibility for the visitor to enter preferred dishes and/or cuisines and get suggestions based on those preferences. 
- The possibility for the site to make suggestions based on what vegetables and fruits are in season in the visitors country at the moment. For a cheaper and more environment-friendly dish.
- The possibility for the site to gather information about prices at shops local to the visitor. For a cheaper dish.
- The possibility for the visitor to log what dishes and/or cuisines the visitor have eaten in the recent days/weeks and get suggestions based on those logs. For a more diverse eating experience.

- High colour contrast between backround and text
